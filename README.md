# ASV Quick Vis tools

This repo contains quick-vis scripts for ASV data using R programming language. The outputs are not pretty, but they are useful for first-pass data exploration.

_loitercheck.R scripts plot data from the analysis_ready folder in DartFS to check to see if the provided path file matches the processed ASV .csv file. Maps land in the intermediary/map_reality_check folder on DartFS
